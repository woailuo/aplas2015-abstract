\section{Problem and Motivation}
In order to prevent dynamic memory-management related errors such as
memory leaks and illegal read/write/free operations to deallocated
memory cells, many static verification techniques have been
proposed~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/SuenagaK09,DBLP:conf/pldi/HeineL03,DBLP:conf/sigsoft/XieA05,DBLP:journals/scp/SwamyHMGJ06,DBLP:conf/sas/OrlovichR06,DBLP:conf/issta/SuiYX12}.
These analyses proposed so far mainly guarantee \emph{partial}
memory-leak freedom: All the allocated memory cells are deallocated
\emph{if a program terminates}.  We say a program is \emph{total}
memory-leak free if it consumes bounded number of memory cells during
execution.

In real-world programs, total memory-leak freedom is an important
property (e.g., operating system and Web servers). However, analyses
for partial memory-leak freedom is not enough for such software that
does not terminate.

\begin{exmp}\label{ex:ex1}
\begin{figure}[h]
1  \;\;$h()$= \dtb \dtb  \dtb      \dtb          \dtb $h'()$= \\
2  \dtb $\LET \; x = \MALLOC  \; \IN$ \dtb \;\;\;\;$\LET \; x = \MALLOC  \; \IN$\\
3  \dtb $\LET \; y = \MALLOC  \; \IN$ \dtb \;\;\;\; $\LET \; y = \MALLOC  \; \IN$\\
4  \dtb $\Free(x)$; $\Free(y) $;\;$h()$ \dtb \;\;\;\;\;\;$h'()$; $\Free\Cirx$; \ $\Free(y)$
\caption{Memory leaks in nonterminating programs.}
\label{ex:np}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{ex:np} describes partial and total memory-leak freedom.
Both \(h\) and \(h'\) are partially memory-leak free because they do
not terminate.  The function \(h\) is totally memory-leak free since
it consumes at most two cells\footnote{We assume that \(\MALLOC\)
  allocates a fixed-sized block}.  However, the function \(h'\), when
it is invoked, consumes unbounded number of memory cells; hence \(h'\)
is not totally memory-leak free, which may cause overflow.
\end{exmp}

Currently, we want to guarantee, total memory-leak freedom, that a
program consumes bounded number of memory cells during execution.

\section{Approach}
Our method is to abstract the behavior of programs by a
\emph{behavioral type
  system}~\cite{DBLP:journals/lmcs/KobayashiSW06,DBLP:journals/tcs/IgarashiK04,DBLP:conf/esop/HondaVK98}.
Behavioral types are described by sequential processes whose actions
represent memory allocation and deallocation. For example, our type
system can assign a type
\(\mu\alpha.\Malloc\TSEQ\Malloc\TSEQ\Free\TSEQ\Free\TSEQ\alpha\) to
the function \(h\) in Figure~\ref{ex:np}.  This type expresses that
\(h\) can allocate a memory cell twice, deallocate a memory cell
twice, and then iterate this behavior.  The type assigned to \(h'\) in
Figure~\ref{ex:np} is
\(\mu\alpha.\Malloc\TSEQ\Malloc\TSEQ\alpha\TSEQ\Free;\Free\), which
expresses that \(h'\) can allocate a memory cell twice, call itself
recursively, and then deallocate a memory cell twice.  Hence, by
inspecting the inferred types (for example, by using some model
checkers), one can estimate the upper bound required to execute \(h\)
and \(h'\).

Notice that, our behavioral type system only about the number and the
order of allocations, deallocations and recursive calls; hence, the
type system does not guarantee that illegal accesses to a dangling
pointer.  However, combining safe-memory-deallocation analyses (e.g.,
one proposed by Suenaga and
Kobayashi~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/SuenagaK09}) with our behavioral type
system, we can verify safe-memory-deallocation even for nonterminating
programs.

\subsection{Language}
The definition of the language is as follows; It
is a sublanguage of Suenaga and Kobayashi~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/SuenagaK09}.
\[
\begin{array}{rlcl}
  s & (\mbox{statements})&::=&\SKIP \tB s_{1};s_{2} \tB *x \leftarrow y \tB \Free \Cirx \\
  & & & \tB \LET\; x = \MALLOC \; \IN \; s  \\
  & & & \tB \LET x = y \; \IN s \tB \LET x = \NULL \; \IN s \\
  & & & \tB \LET x = *y  \; \IN s \\
  & &  & \tB f(\vec{x}) \tB \IFNULL(x) \; \THEN s_{1}\; \ELSE s_{2} \\
\end{array}
\]

%% \begin{eqnarray*}
%%   x,y,z,\dots \mbox{ (variables)} &\in& \VAR\\
%%   s \mbox{ (statements)} & ::= &  \SKIP \mid s_{1};s_{2} \mid *x \leftarrow y \mid \Free(x) \\
%%   & \mid & \LET x = \MALLOC \IN s \mid \LET x = \NULL\ \IN s  \\
%%   & \mid & \LET x = y \; \IN s \mid   \LET x = *y \; \IN s \\
%%   & \mid & \IFNULL(x) \; \THEN s_{1}\; \ELSE s_{2} \mid f(\vec{x})\\
%%   d \mbox{ (proc. defs.)} & ::= & \set{f \mapsto (x_1,\dots,x_n)s}\\
%%   D \mbox{(definitions) } &::=& \langle d_1 \cup \dots \cup d_n \rangle\\
%%   P \mbox{ (programs)} &::=& \langle D, s \rangle\\
%% \end{eqnarray*}

The command $\SKIP$ does nothing; the sequence $s_{1};s_{2}$ means the
executing order of $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$; \(*x \leftarrow y\) updates
the content of cell pointed by \(x\) with the value \(y\); command
$\Free\Cirx$ deallocates the memory cell through the pointer $x$; the
command \(\MALLOC\) allocates a memory cell; \(*y\) dereferences a
pointer \(y\); \(\LET x = e \; \IN s\) first binds \(x\) to the value of
\(e\), and then executes \(s\); $f(\vec{x})$ means a function call
which receives some parameters. Here $\vec{x}$ represents a sequence
of variables \(\{x_1,...,x_n\}\);
\(\IFNULL(x)\ \THEN\ s_1\ \ELSE\ s_2\) executes \(s_1\) if \(x\) is
\(\NULL\), otherwise \(s_2\).  For simplification, we omit definitions
for function, program and variables.

A program \emph{leaks} memory if the program consumes unbounded number
of memory cells.  For example, see Figure~\ref{ex:np} again, \(h\)
does not leak memory, whereas \(h'\) does; the former
consumes at most two memory cells at once but the latter consumes
unbounded number of memory cells.

\subsection{Behavioral Type System}
 We define behavioral types, CCS-like processes that abstract the
 behavior of programs, as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{rlcl}
  P & (\mbox{behavioral types})&::=& {\bf 0} \tB P_{1};P_{2} \tB P_{1}+P_{2} \\
     & & & \tB \Malloc \tB \Free \tB \alpha \tB \mu\alpha.P \\
  \Gamma & (\mbox{variable type environments}) &::=& \set{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n}\\
  \Theta & (\mbox{function type environments}) &::=& \set{f_1\COL P_1,\dots,f_n\COL P_n}\\
\end{array}
\]

The type {\bf 0} is the behavior "does nothing"; $P_{1};P_{2}$ is for
sequential execution; $P_{1}+P_{2}$ is for choice; $\Malloc$ is the
behavior of a program that allocates a memory cell exactly once;
$\Free$ is for deallocating exactly once; $\mu\alpha.P$ is the
recursive type. For example, in Figure~\ref{ex:np}, function \(h\) has
the type
\(\mu\alpha.\Malloc\TSEQ\Malloc\TSEQ\Free\TSEQ\Free\TSEQ\alpha\);
function \(h'\) has the type
\(\mu\alpha.\Malloc\TSEQ\Malloc\TSEQ\alpha\TSEQ\Free\TSEQ\Free\).  The
semantics of behavioral types is given by a labeled transition system,
which is omitted.

The type judgment of our type system is of the form $\Theta;\Gamma\vdash s :
P$.  It reads "under environments \(\Theta\) and  \(\Gamma\) the behavior
of \(s\) is as described in \(P\)".  We design the type system so that
\(\Theta;\Gamma \vdash s : P\) implies the following property:
\begin{quotation}
When \(s\) executes \(\Malloc\) (resp. \(\Free\)), then \(P\) is
equivalent to \(\Malloc;P'\) (resp. \(\Free;P'\)) for a type \(P'\)
such that \(\Theta;\Gamma \vdash s' : P'\), where \(s'\) is the continuation
of \(s\).
\end{quotation}
This property guarantees that the behavioral types soundly
approximates the upper bound of the consumed memory cells.

We present two typing rules. 
\begin{figure}[t]
$$ \frac{}
{\Theta;\Gamma \vdash \Free() : \Free} 
\Rtab \mbox{(T-Free)} $$
$$ \frac{\Theta;\Gamma \vdash s : P}
{\Theta;\Gamma \vdash \LET x = \MALLOC \; \IN s  : \Malloc;P} 
\Rtab \mbox{(T-Malloc)} $$
\caption{Typing rules for $\Free()$ and $\MALLOC$ }
\end{figure}
%\textbf{TODO: Explanation of typing rules here}
The rule $\mbox{T-Free}$ represents that the behavior of \(\Free()\)
is \(\Free\). The rule $\mbox{T-Malloc}$ represents that \(\LET\ x =
\MALLOC\ \IN\ s\) has the behavior \(\MALLOC;P\), where \(P\) is the
behavior of \(s\).

\section{Experiment}
To check feasibility of our behavioral type system for verification of
total memory-leak freedom and investigate problems in current type
system framework, we apply CPAChecker~\cite{beyer2011cpachecker} (1)
to the original program and (2) to the program which represents the
abstracted behavior of original one.

\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{figexp}, the result of verification \(Success\)
represents a program consumes bounded number of memory, while \(Fail\)
represents a program consumes unbounded number of memory cells.

\subsection{Preciseness}
Figure~\ref{figexp} shows that our type system is too imprecise to verify total
memory-leak freedom of the programs.

The reason is that our method is not path-sensitive, and it simply
rejects the programs which allocate cells before recursive calls. We
have checked many of source codes from Github and Linux kernel and
found that extending our behavioral type system with dependencies is
useful for our future work.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \[
  \begin{array}{rlcl}
  P &  &::=& \ldots \\
  & & &\tB \mbox{CASE(x) \{VALUE\_1 : $P_1$; \ldots ; VALUE\_n: $P_n$  \}}\\
\end{array}
\]

\caption{Extension to dependent types}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{ex:beh} shows that extending current behavioral type
system with dependent types. 



\section{Related Works}
Many static verification methods have been
proposed~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/SuenagaK09,DBLP:conf/pldi/HeineL03,DBLP:conf/sigsoft/XieA05,DBLP:journals/scp/SwamyHMGJ06,DBLP:conf/sas/OrlovichR06,DBLP:conf/issta/SuiYX12}
for memory-leak freedom. These methods guarantee partial memory-leak
freedom and no illegal accesses to deallocated cells, whereas our
behavioral type system guarantees total memory-leak freedom. By using
both their methods and our type system, we can guarantee
safe-memory-deallocation even for nonterminationg programs.

Behavioral types are extensively studied in the context of concurrent
program
verification~\cite{DBLP:conf/esop/HondaVK98,DBLP:journals/tcs/IgarashiK04,DBLP:conf/esop/VieiraCS08,DBLP:journals/lmcs/KobayashiSW06}.
Our type system is largely inspired by one proposed by Kobayashi et
al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/lmcs/KobayashiSW06}, which guarantees that a
concurrent program accesses resources according to specification.

\section{Conclusion}
To verify memory-leak freedom for possibly nonterminating programs, we
have proposed a behavioral type system which abstracts the behavior of
programs with allocation and deallocation. We have proved the type
soundness and conducted experiments to check feasibility of our
approach.

The allocation primitives defined in our type system ignore the size
of the allocated block for simplification.  Hence, our approach may
see a memory-leak program as a well-typed one.  Variable-length cells
will be included in our future work.  Another feature should be
considered is path-sensitive, because our behavioral type system is
not enough to check memory-leak freedom. For preciseness, we are going
to extend our type system with dependencies.
